# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Examples

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

A comprehensive repository showcasing examples of implementing **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** features. This repository serves as a resource for developers to understand and build upon MCP implementations using Python.

## What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

The Model Context Protocol is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs). It defines a consistent interface for tools, resources, and prompts, enabling seamless integration between LLMs and various data sources or capabilities.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into several key sections:

### Patterns

- **Composability**
  - Client-orchestrated workflows
  - Proxy server implementations
  - Server-to-server communication

- **Orchestration**
  - Centralized orchestrators
  - Dynamic workflow orchestration
  - Event-driven orchestration

### Prompts

- Conditional workflows
- Dynamic arguments
- Orchestrated pipelines
- Slash commands
- Including resources in prompts

### Resources

- API integrations
- Database connections
- File system operations

### Tools

- API integration patterns
- Chunked processing
- Data processing
- Notification systems
- Semantic search implementation
- Stateful session management
- System command patterns

### Sampling

- Client implementations
- Server implementations
